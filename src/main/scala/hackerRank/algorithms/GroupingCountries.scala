  Grouping Countries
    People in a group, are sitting in a row numbered from 1 to n. Every has been asked the same question, “How many people of your country are there in the group?”
  The answers provided by the people may be incorrect. People of the same country always sit together. If all answers are correct determine the number of distinct countries else print “Invalid Answer”.

  Examples:

    Input : ans[] = {1, 3, 2, 2}
  Output : Invalid Answer
    The second person says there are 3
  people from his country however
  the person sitting next to him says
  there are 2 people. Hence this is
    an invalid answer.

    Input : ans[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4,
    4, 4}
  Output : 4
  There are 1 person each representing
    two distinct countries. In the next
  one there are two people and in the
    fourth one there are 4 people from
  the same country.
